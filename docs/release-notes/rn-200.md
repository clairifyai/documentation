### Real-Time Email Sync

* **Force Sync** – Manual trigger to reconcile inbox differences from the last 7 days, ensuring accuracy if changes were made outside Clairify.
* **Weekly Sync** – Automatic CRON-based sync every 7 days.
* **Auto Unsubscribe** – Automatically detaches inactive or expired inboxes to conserve system resources and prevent retry loops.

### Swiping Adjudication

Gesture-based email triage using the Eisenhower matrix:

* **Mark as Read** – Swipe right to mark as read.
* **Mark for Deletion** – Swipe left to indicate removal.
* **Discard** – Permanently remove or archive unnecessary emails.
* **Skip Cards** – Bypass a card for later review.

### Email Labeling

Synchronizes in-app categorization with native Gmail/Outlook labels. Actions in Clairify apply directly to the inbox, ensuring organizational consistency. Examples include:

* **Right-swipe** → `ClairifyRead` label, remove unread label.
* **Left-swipe** → `ClairifyTrash` label, add Trash label.
* **Important click** → `ClairifyImportant` label.
* **Archive click** → `ClairifyArchive` label.

# Primary Email

Clairify supports two email integrations: Outlook and Gmail. You must choose an email from one of these providers to create your account. Once your account is created, this email is both your login ID and your primary email address with respect to summarization.

## Account Deletion

You can delete your account at any time from the mobile app. This results in all of your data being purged from our system.

1. Open the settings drawer.
2. Under 'Primary Account', click your email address.
3. Click 'Delete Account'.

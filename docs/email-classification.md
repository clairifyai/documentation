# Email Classification

You can customize the way that messages are summarized, so whether you like terse one-liners or nested bullets, you have the ability to completely personalize your experience.

The foundation is an email classification system. For example, it should be intuitive that newsletters and SaaS notifications should be summarized differently, and so it follows that the first thing we need to do is distinguish between them. To that end, Clarirify has many system-defined classes. 

The result of the classification exercise is that we are able to categorize all your messages, and the messages within each category appear pretty consistent in terms of communication style, length, and formatting. This means we're able to select the most suitable system prompt for the category to make each summary visually pleasing and instantly comprehensible.

By default we have paired each category with one of several sytem-defined summarization prompts. But, using web app, you can create custom classes and new system prompts to get everything exactly the way you like it.

!!! tip

    Personalize your experience using a combination of custom classes and custom summarization prompts.

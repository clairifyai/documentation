# Digests

When emails are fetched from your email provider, we first classify the email into one of 8 categories. You can see this type of categorization at work in Gmail; their defaults at the time of this writing are social, updates, forums, and promotions. Weâ€™ve extended the concept in order to gain precise control over presentation.

Digests are a single summary, of all unread emails of a single category. The purpose of this feature is to enable you to catch up on messages quickly in case you fall behind. If you mark this item as aware  or delete, then all of the messages used as source for the digest will have their associated summaries marked the same. By default, digests will be added into your main briefing book every day at 8am and 8pm UTC.

# Email Summarization

!!! Warning

    This page is under construction, I'll remove it when the page is g2g.

The premise of Clairify is to bring all of your inbound messages into a single stream, and then summarize them and present them in a way that an executive can understand. The natural place to start is with email since that is where most people receive their personal communications, SaaS notifications, and scheduled reports.

* **Primary Email Address** - Clairify supports two email integrations: Outlook and Gmail. You must choose an email from one of these providers to create your account. Once your account is created, this email is both your login ID and your primary email address with respect to summarization.

* **Secondary Email Address** - Most of us have more than one email address. At minimum we have work and personal addresses. For this reason, Clairify supports summarizing emails for up to 4 email addresses in addition to your primary email. The number of allowed secondary email addresses depends on your service tier; see the pricing page.

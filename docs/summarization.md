# Summarization

The premise of Clairify is to bring all of your inbound messages into a single stream, and then summarize them and present them in a way that an executive can understand. The natural place to start is with email since that is where most people receive their personal communications, SaaS notifications, and scheduled reports.

* [**Primary Email Address**](primary-email.md) - Clairify supports two email integrations: Outlook and Gmail. You must choose an email from one of these providers to create your account. Once your account is created, this email is both your login ID and your primary email address with respect to summarization.

* **Secondary Email Address** - Most of us have more than one email address. At minimum we have a work and a personal address. That's why Clairify supports summarizing additional inboxes. The number of secondary email addresses you can connect depends on your service tier; see [Feature Matrix](feature-matrix.md).

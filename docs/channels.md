# Channels

Clairify Channels are dedicated, semantic spaces for organizing communications. Each channel is powered by an agent that can filters noise, extract meaningful signals, and turn conversations into knowledge. Channels are designed to drive organizational alignment while reducing cognitive load, eliminating FOMO, and supporting healthier, async-first workflows.

Highlights:

- **Separate Streams** – Channels split your communications by any project or topic so you’re not overwhelmed by a single messy inbox.
- **Seamless Distribution** – Make it simple to keep the right people in the loop without blasting their inbox.
- **Signal Extraction** – An always-on agent, guided by your instructions extracts meaningful signals and directs your attention to what matters most in the moment.
- **Q&A** – Channels allows conversations to becaome a living knowledge base. Instead of searching or scrolling, you can ask a Q&A agent.

## Personal Channels

A **Personal Channel** works much like folders or labels in Gmail or Outlook: It’s a personal categorization system for keeping related messages together. You can create a channel from your own message categories (for example, “Finance Alerts,” “Client Updates,” or “Family Messages”), and it will de-clutter in a familiar way. But Private Channels go beyond static filing: You can instruct an always-on agent to monitor activity inside the channel to pull out meaningful signals — like deadlines, approvals, or sudden activity spikes — highlight them for you.

## Shared Channels

A **Shared Channel** adds delegation and observability. Unlike labels or folders, which stay locked to one person’s view, a channel can be carved out of a private inbox and selectively shared. This creates a “partially shared inbox” experience: you don’t need to forward every relevant message manually, and collaborators gain visibility into just the stream you’ve exposed. Shared channels are especially useful in targeted scenarios — for example, if the CEO receives a customer request, it can be dropped into a “Delegated to Sulav." He then has direct visibility into those messages without needing full inbox access, making shared channels ideal for lightweight delegation, accountability, and small-circle observability.

## Team Channels

A **Team Channel** is best understood as a shared knowledge stream. Instead of each person holding onto siloed communications, everyone working on Project A can direct relevant updates — whether they arrive by email, Slack, or other monitored sources — into a single channel. This doesn’t replace chat or email for back-and-forth conversation, but it ensures that the underlying information — customer requests, stakeholder updates, internal discussions, reports — is collected in one place. The result is alignment and visibility: The channel becomes the reference corpus for the team, reducing the risk of missed context and keeping everyone working from the same set of facts.

## Public Channels

A **Public Channel** takes the concept one step further by opening it up to a broader audience. These channels are typically created by vendors or organizations to share updates, product announcements, or newsletters with their customers. Unlike social media posts or marketing emails, content in public channels won't be buried or summarized by agents and algorithms. Your brand remains intact, and your updates are always reach the decision makers who have asked to hear from you, and you gain unique insight into what resonates and what gets ignored. The result is a distribution model where you no longer compete for attention in crowded spaces.

## Q&A for Channels

Any channel can have AI-powered question and answering (Q&A) turned on. Q&A turns channels into queryable knowledge spaces. Onboard new members, find context on demand, and reduce interruptions, and catch up easily when you fall behind by simply asking questions. An AI agent continously monitors the channel to gather facts and those facts have a longer time to live (TTL), much greater than the 30 day story-retention period. Long-term retention means that the burden on your own memory, and the burden to be aware in the moment vanishes. The critical difference between Clairify and other AI assistants is that that it's corpus of knowledge is based on all the information about the topic you defined, from all the data sources you connected. This means the knowledge isn't splintered across the native AI in those respective apps. Clairify has the full story whereas the other AI agents don't.

    Our agents deliver topical completeness they have access to data from multiple sources.
    
!!! tip    
    The knowledge captured is limited to information passing in an out of the executive sphere. This results in a smaller corpus with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Since AI answers degrade in proportion to the length of the context window, for any given period time, our AI agent yields better results than those built on mixed organizational chatter. 

## Signal Extraction

Any channel can have ambient agent turned on. An ambient agent continuously monitors the channel for important information based on a prompt you write, for example, "highlight any customer complaints." You also control how signals arrive, choosing between instant alerts, digests, or incorporated into daily briefings. You can change the instruction at any time, so the agent adapts as your priorities shift. Ambient agents eliminate the need to constantly monitor multiple streams, preventing the fractured attention that comes from trying to stay aware of everything at once.

## Channels vs. Others

| **Category** | **Strengths** | **Limits** |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **Incumbent Email (Gmail, Outlook)** | Ubiquitous; enterprise-trusted; robust routing with rules, folders, and categories. | Containers are personal-only, not shared. Monitoring is passive — users must dig into folders to find signal. Limited to email as a single data source. |
| **Newer Email Clients (Superhuman, Missive, HEY, Unroll.me)** | Modern triage features such as split inboxes, sender screening, collaborative inboxes, and newsletter digests. | Still email-centric and designed for team addresses like support@ or sales@. Limited to email as a single data source for AI agents. No continuous monitoring — users must still scan for what matters. Does not support selective sharing of personal inbox content. |
| **Instant Messaging (Slack, Teams, Google Chat)** | Shared channels by default; strong for real-time collaboration; wide adoption across teams. | Create fear of missing important information, leading to always-on pressure and constant context-switching. AI agents must filter through massive volumes of conversational noise. Knowledge is limited to what was discussed rather than comprehensive topical information from multiple sources. |
| **Clairify Channels (Personal, Shared, Team, Public)** | Dedicated, semantic spaces for communications. Channels reduce cognitive load, eliminate FOMO, and support async-first workflows. They can be private for personal organization, shared for targeted delegation, team-based for collective knowledge, or public for vendor/customer distribution. Every channel can be powered by an agent that extracts signals and supports Q&A, creating queryable knowledge spaces with long-term retention and high signal-to-noise. | Requires a new workflow model — channels sit alongside inboxes and chats rather than replacing them. Collaboration is structured around visibility, delegation, Q&A, and signal extraction, not inline replies or chat-style threading. |

# On-demand Inbox Sync

There are two cases when you might experience a data gap in your Clairify experience: 

1. If you log out, Clairify is no longer authorized to fetch emails.
2. If the service is down, you will similarly experience a gap. 

To ensure that you have continuity in your experience, each inbox can be manually synced.
